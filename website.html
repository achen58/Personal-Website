    <div id="About">
      <p>I am a recent graduate at Binghamton University with specialization in computer engineering. I have experience coding in C, VHDL and lightly brushed on C++ from my coursework. On my free time, I delved into web development languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and also been teaching myself Java. I have also worked with different hardware including FPGA boards, Arduino boards, and 8-bit microcontrollers such as the ATMEL AVR. </p>

     <p><strong> SAE Formula Hybrid(Electric Sub Team),Binghamton,NY </strong></p>
     <ul class="list">
       <li>Collaborated with Drivetrain/Suspensions and Systems Integration sub teams on a two-semester long project to successfully design and build a formula style race car for competition</li>
       <li>Modified past iteration of Arduino code to monitor the control system of the vehicle</li>
       <li>Coded Arduino program using C to control serial communications between multiple Arduino</li>
     </ul> 
     
     <p><strong> Metal Detector Rover 5 Project,Binghamton,NY </strong></p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Collaborated with a team of two electrical engineers and one computer engineer to design an autonomous robot that avoids object and detects four metal washers placed randomly in a 6ftx6ft enclosure</li>
        <li>Coded Arduino program using C to survey enclosure using multiple HC-SRO4 ultrasonic sensors on rover</li>
        <li>Successfully found 3 out 4 metal washers and was able to avoid objects and walls</li>
    </ul>
     
     <p><strong>Line Following Maze Rover,Binghamton,NY</strong></p>
     <ul class="list">
       <li>Constructed a system for users to perform controlled movements on the rover using the FPGA board </li>
       <li>Developed a system which allowed the Rover 5 to solve a maze autonomously using the FPGA board and QTR-8A reflectance sensors</li>
